Okay so in this module, we went through and took a look at the different phases that software applications run through. We started off talking about the planning phase. This is where we go through, we plan out, from a security perspective, how the application should run. We train developers in those requirements. We acquire the tools that we need to analyze our applications. 
We also talked about the requirements phase. This is, again, where we determine a need for security and privacy, in terms of data processing and access controls.
We then went through and looked at the design phase where we identify threats and controls and where we will implement secure coding practices, and we'll talk about that in another module coming up. 
We then talked about that tricky one, the implementation phase, which isn't actually implementing as in letting people use stuff, it's more of testing from a white box environment. And since it was the white box, the black box version of that same testing phase or similar testing phase is called the, yep, there it is, testing phase. 
We then talked about the deployment phase, where we are making sure that the source authenticity of the installer packages and our best practice configuration guides are being followed.
We then talked about the maintenance phase where we are doing ongoing security monitoring and incident response procedures, we're doing patch management, updates of both the application or the software, as well as anything or any software/hardware related resources in the back end. 
And then finally, we talked about end-of-life. How do we gracefully bow out when we're ready to get rid of the software? That we make sure that we don't actually create security or attack vectors by removal of the application or software. Okay, now that we got the phases out of the way, next up we're going to take a look at some models.
